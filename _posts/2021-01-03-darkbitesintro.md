I'm contributing to [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click), a series of social media posts that will highlight the papers describing the Dark Energy Survey's Year 3 galaxy clustering and weak lensing analysis. I'm  working with Ross Cawthon (Wisconson) and Chihway Chang (Chicago) to coordinate this project, and a number of other DES members are contributing artwork and writing. I edited the text of a large fraction of the ~30 posts and contributed artwork for about a quarter of them. I'm planning on uploading that artwork here as the posts become public.  

[The twitter thread of the Y3 Darkbites posts begins here.](https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1334937310606004227) The same images are also being shared on the DES [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/darkenergysurvey) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/darkenergysurvey/) pages.


This image was used as [part of the post](https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1334939591585959946) introducing the Darkbites series:

Each of the contributors drew their own self portrait. I drew the laptop and zoom setup, and inserted the individual drawings into the collage.  The associated text was:
> Thanks to [@astroalexamon](https://twitter.com/astroalexamon) [@CosmoloGirl](https://twitter.com/CosmoloGirl) and Niall for curating the excellent [#thisisDES](https://twitter.com/hashtag/thisisDES?src=hashtag_click) series! If you missed it, be sure to check out their of posts about the journey to DES science: [https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1317886835599712256](https://twitter.com/theDESurvey/status/1317886835599712256)

> Now that we’ve completed that cosmological journey, we’re going to shift gears to feature some of the papers that have been released for the DES Year 3 (Y3) analysis. 
> 
> To do this we’ll be reviving the #Darkbites series, which we’ve used in the past to post a weekly illustration of a fun fact related to DES science. If you’d like to see previous [#darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) illustrations, you can find them here: [https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/education/darkbites/](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/education/darkbites/)
> 
> This time [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) will be a little different, in that the posts will be themed around papers that document the results and methods of the DES Y3 analysis. A couple times a week we’ll post a cartoon and short description, along with a link to the associated paper. 
> 
> Like all things in DES, #darkbites is a product of teamwork! Ross Cawthon (Wisconsin) is coordinating posts, and our illustrators are Chihway Chang, Dimitros Tanoglidis, Louise Gagnon (all at Chicago), @jlynnmuir (Stanford), and Eric Baxter (Hawaii). 
> 
> Authors of many papers have also contributed writing and ideas for illustrations! More info about the papers can be found on the DES website: [https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/des-year-3-cosmology-results-papers/](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/des-year-3-cosmology-results-papers/).
