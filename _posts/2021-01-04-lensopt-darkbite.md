This cartoon is part of the DES Y3 [#Darkbites](https://twitter.com/hashtag/darkbites?src=hashtag_click) social media series. It was drawn to illustrate the paper led by Anna Porredon ([website](https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/porredon.1), [twitter](https://twitter.com/annamporredon)), titled  "Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Optimizing the Lens Sample in Combined Galaxy Clustering and Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing Analysis." ([arXiv:2011.03411](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03411))

> We can learn about the distribution of matter in the Universe by studying the relationship between how gravitational lensing distorts the images of distant galaxies, and the positions of galaxies closer to us which cause that lensing. 
> 
> Just like you need the right glasses prescription to see clearly, choosing those lens galaxies carefully allows us to get as much information as possible out of our analysis 
> 
> This paper explores how to pick lens galaxies to optimize the amount of information they provide: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03411](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03411)
