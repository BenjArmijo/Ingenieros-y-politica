I've drawn a couple of cartoons for Darkbites, a social media based outreach effort through the Dark Energy Survey. They appeared on DES social media accounts accompanied by text describing a fun science fact. [Darkbites website](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/education/darkbites/)

This illustration of the Blanco telescope with the constellation Vega in the backgroud was drawn to illustrate the statement: "The walk from the astronomerâ€™s lodge to the DES control room is about 1km long, or 1200 steps. If you could walk to the star Vega, it would take about 284 quadrillion steps!"
