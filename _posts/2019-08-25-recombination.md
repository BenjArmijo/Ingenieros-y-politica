This animation was used to talk about recombination. When the universe is ionized light interacts strongly with them and so can't travel very far without scattering off a charged particle. Once the protons and electrons combine to form neutral Hydrogen atoms, the light is able travel in a straight line, which means the universe becomes transparent.
