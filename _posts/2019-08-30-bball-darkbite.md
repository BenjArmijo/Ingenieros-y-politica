I've drawn a couple of cartoons for Darkbites, a social media based outreach effort through the Dark Energy Survey. They appeared on DES social media accounts accompanied by text describing a fun science fact. [Darkbites website](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/education/darkbites/)

This illustration was drawn to illustrate the statement: "If the Earth were the size of a basketball and placed in the hoop, the moon would be roughly at the three-point line. The sun would be 100 court lengths away!"
