As part of the local organizing committee for the 2015 [APS Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP)](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/cuwip/) at the University of Michigan, Veronica Policht and I designed buttons featuring pioneering women in physics. These buttons were handed out to conference participants and used to split the participants into groups for icebreaker activites.
